    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Navodaya
      Institute of Technology, affiliated with VTU, with a strong academic
      background and a CGPA of 8.75. Throughout my academic journey, I have
      developed a keen interest in software development, particularly in areas
      such as web technologies, backend development, and cybersecurity. My
      education, combined with hands-on project work, has helped me build a
      strong foundation in programming and logical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked on various projects that demonstrate my practical skills,
      including a School Fees Management System, a Real Estate Portal, and a
      digital security solution using DFA-AOKDF. These experiences have not only
      improved my technical abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and MySQL
      but have also strengthened my problem-solving, time management, and
      teamwork skills. I have further enhanced my capabilities through
      certifications in Python, IoT, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and
      Full Stack Development.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a fresher, I bring a strong willingness to learn, adapt, and contribute
      meaningfully to any team I join. I am passionate about building efficient
      and user-friendly applications and eager to apply my knowledge in a
      real-world setting. I am now looking for opportunities where I can grow
      professionally, collaborate with experienced developers, and make a
      positive impact through technology.
